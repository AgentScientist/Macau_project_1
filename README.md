## Drug response prediction in 4 different settings: 

Setting 1: macau_GDSC.py

Setting 2: macau_GDSC_pred_new_drug.py

Setting 3: macau_GDSC_transduction.py

Setting 4: macau_GDSC_pred_new_drug_new_cell.py

You may need a certain environment to submit your job (depending on the cluster): cluster_script_GDSC.sh


## Generate the interaction matrix: 

Step 1: use macau_GDSC_pred_new_drug_new_cell.py (for one tissue) or macau_GDSC_interaction_tissue_QC.py (for all tissues) to check the quality of the features. 

Make sure the performance is greater than 0.3, otherwise don't go further because your input data is simply not predictive of the response.

Step 2: Generate the interaction matrix using macau_GDSC_transduction.py

Step 3: use macau_GDSC_interaction_tissue_PERMUTATION.py to do random permutation of the cell lines side features. This gives p-value for each data point of the interaction matrix.

## Plot the results:

Analyse the drug response prediction result: Drug_response_analysis.Rmd

Analysis feature interaction result: GDSC_interaction_analysis_Tissue.Rmd

Scatter plot of the result using: Scatter_plots.Rmd

## Simply download the results:

In folder target_progeny11: interaction matrices for 16 GDSC tissues. Since drug target is binary, make sure to ONLY CONSIDER proteins targeted by at least 2 differents drugs. 

In folder target_progeny11_PERMUTATION: one file about the counts generated by the permutation in order to compute the p-value ; one file for the p-value matrix ; one file for the BHY corrected p-value.
